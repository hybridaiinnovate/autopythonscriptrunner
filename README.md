pyrunner.py is a lightweight Python execution tool that automatically compiles and runs Python scripts with built-in error handling and output capture.

It streamlines development workflows by eliminating manual compile/run steps and ensuring scripts are validated before execution.

Features

🔁 Automatically compiles Python files before execution

▶️ Executes scripts seamlessly after successful compilation

📤 Captures stdout and stderr

⚠️ Clear syntax and runtime error reporting

🧩 Minimal setup and easy integration

How It Works

Compiles the target Python file using Python’s built-in compilation mechanisms.
