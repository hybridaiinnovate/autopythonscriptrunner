# 💤 PyRunner  
## Because Activating Virtual Environments Is Emotional Labor

> "It works on my machine."

PyRunner is what happens when you are too tired to:

- create venv
- activate venv
- install requirements
- figure out what framework this repo even uses
- read the README
- think

So you don’t.

You drag.
It runs.

# 🧠 What This Thing Actually Does

You drop a random Python project into it.

It:

- 🧪 Creates a virtual environment
- 📦 Installs dependencies
- 🔎 Detects what framework you’re dealing with
- 🏃 Runs the correct entrypoint
- 📡 Streams logs
- 🛑 Lets you panic-stop it

You:
- 😌 Sit there
- ☕ Sip something
- 🧘 Experience inner peace
